# linux-remote-configuration-management: lrcm.io

![lrcm.io main image](./lrcm.io.drawio.png)

## main goal

At first we had the need to implement a remote configuration management for some Linux clients
- somewhere in the world
- not accessible
- not always online
- using a secure way
- in a reproducable way
- standardized

We had a first client - a bash-script - running for two years doing all the things we need, but the need for more features brought us here.

## what you get

You get an agent for your favorite Linux distribution in a fully working manner with a configured dummy backend.

## what you can do

You can change the configuration to use your own git instance and develop your own playbooks, roles, etc. You can also use Github as backend. Maybe our commercial offer - a very secure Gitlab instance - is also interesting for you. We're also offering our engineers to develop the playbooks you need for configuration management.

Debian 11
